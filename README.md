This GitHub Action extracts dependencies from an Elixir project using
[`mix`](https://hexdocs.pm/mix) and submits them to
[GitHub's Dependency Submission API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/dependency-graph/dependency-submission),
helping you unlock advanced dependency graph and security features for your
project.

## Why Use This?

By submitting your dependencies to GitHub:

- 🔐 **Stay secure** – Receive
  [Dependabot alerts and security updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts) for
  known vulnerabilities in your direct and transitive dependencies.
- 🔎 **Improve visibility** – View your full dependency graph, including
  dependencies not found in lockfiles, right on GitHub.
- 🔁 **Automated updates** – Dependabot can automatically open pull requests to
  fix vulnerable dependencies.
- ✅ **Better reviews** – See dependencies in pull request diffs via GitHub’s
  [Dependency Review](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review).
- 📊 **Support compliance** – Help your team understand and audit what
  third-party code your software depends on.

## Usage

This action is intended to be used within a GitHub Actions workflow.

### Minimal Example

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"

name: "Dependency Submission"

jobs:
  report_mix_deps:
    name: "Report Mix Dependencies"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: erlef/mix-dependency-submission@v1.0.0-beta.8
```

## Inputs

| Name           | Description                                                                                 | Default                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `token`        | GitHub token to use for submission.                                                         | `${{ github.token }}`       |
| `project-path` | Path to the Mix project.                                                                    | `${{ github.workspace }}`   |
| `install-deps` | Whether to run `mix deps.get` before analysis. Set to `true` for accurate transitive info.  | `false`                     |
| `ignore`       | A comma-separated list of directories to ignore when searching for Mix projects.            | *(none)*                    |

> ⚠️ If `install-deps` is set to `false`, the action may not fully resolve transitive dependencies, leading to an incomplete dependency graph.

## Outputs

None.
