## Workflow for Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your branch from `main` if you plan to implement new functionality or
   change existing code significantly; create your branch from the oldest branch
   that is affected by the bug if you plan to fix a bug.
3. Implement your change and add tests for it.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Ensure the code complies with our coding guidelines (see below).
6. Send that pull request!

Please make sure you have
[set up your user name and email address](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
for use with Git. Strings such as `silly nick name <root@localhost>` look really
stupid in the commit history of a project.

We encourage you to
[sign your Git commits with your GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits).

Pull requests for new features must be based on the `main` branch.

We are trying to keep backwards compatibility breaks in `mix-dependency-submission`
to a minimum. Please take this into account when proposing changes.

Due to time constraints, we are not always able to respond as quickly as we
would like. Please do not take delays personal and feel free to remind us if you
feel that we forgot to respond.
